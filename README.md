# ShapeDetection
An Image processing program that is used to detect and recognize geometric shapes [Their names and colors]

## Description

We have a noisy image containing geometric colored shapes. The program uses OpenCV to recognize the following:

• The number of real shapes in the image.

• The color of each one of the detected shapes.

• The type of the shapes e.g. circles, squares or triangles.

## Notes

To execute the program => 

- download **OpenCV2.4.11**

- open the project with Visual Studio 2013

- configure the properties of Visual Studio 2013 by following the steps listed in this link [How to Install OpenCV 2.4.11 in Visual Studio C++ 2013](https://marcomuraresearch.wordpress.com/2015/04/16/install-opencv-visual-studio/)

- run the program using cmd terminal, go to x64/Release directory and run the command prompt terminal.

- type the following command: 

```bash
\x64\Release> "Shape Detection.exe" shapes-noisy.bmp
```
